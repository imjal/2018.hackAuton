## Contribution 

We extended the previous state of art, by creating an extra fully connected layer at the end to include the non image data, because most radiologists also use past patient history in order to diagnose patients. More detail concerning our model is summarized in the paper included in the repository called "hackAuton_Paper.pdf".
